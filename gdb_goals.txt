Mahoney mentions gdb in the notes, this is usually where I work that into the class since they are now working with pointers.

Some things I request you cover about gdb

    teach the students how to turn on core dumping by default (ulimit -c unlimited in .bashrc I think)
    teach the students how to compile with debug information and do a stack trace with a core dump
    teach the students how to step through a program, set breakpoints, etc (as this is necessary if the stack get wacked)
